# ATMEGA328P-4-Bit Wave Generator
Project scale massively reduced, I underestimated the clock speed of the Uno. Was only able to reliably get 100 hz, it's just too much for the device to handle. May re-tackle on a later date with better, dedicated hardware for DACs and make a MIDI output or something.
