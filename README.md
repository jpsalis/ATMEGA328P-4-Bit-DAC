# ATMEGA328P-4-Bit Wave Generator
Project for 2023 RBT 122 class.

Studying the production of multi-bit precision DAC with Arduino.

The clock speed of the Uno reduced its ability to produce audible and reliable sound. Was only able to reliably get 100 hz, it's just too much for the device to handle.

Implementation of this project for audio would require quantization techniques, and dedicated audio hardware.
